Beware that the line endings of the text files will be different on various operating systems. So if you want to use the text files to test the projects, convert the line endings to the appropriate format for your operating system. You might use a simple text editor like **Notepad++** and do: `Edit -> EOL Conversion -> {OS}` where OS is the choice of your operating system. Save the text file and you should be ready to use it.
